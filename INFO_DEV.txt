# how JSON atributes work

             [i] = info icon
             [-] = Shows ▶
             [-+] = NOT WORKING
             [UPDATE] = shows update
             [S] = space
             [B] = blank
    AT END = [NEW] = new info
             [C] = makes text blue

Correct order: 
Normal:
[B][S]

Has info:
[i][S][C] 

Extra:
[B] is blank. It was made so that it aligns with [i]. If title has no [i] put a [B]
