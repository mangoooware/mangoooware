  <h1>SMA</h1>
  SMA (Simple Moving Average) calculates the moving average of a stock on your chosen timeframe. This is called a period. 
  <h1>Calculating SMA</h1>
  
  <h2>1. We will choose a 5 day SMA meaning you will need to get the last 5 days + todays stock price:</h2>
 We need 6 days worth of closing prices on our stock like this:

<div class="chart-container">
  <canvas id="priceChart"></canvas>
   <i>Do not add todays price into SMA. Yesterday is last.</i>
</div>

  <br><h2>2. The SMA formula goes as followed:<br><br></h2>
  Add the closing prices together and devide them by the number of days. In our case that would be:<br><br>

  <div class="inline-math-box">
\[
\text{SMA} = \frac{A_1 + A_2 + \cdots + A_n}{n}
\]

\[
A_n = \text{the closing prices of the stock ($A$) per day ($_n$)}
\] 

\[
n = \text{the number of total days/periods}
\]
</div>

<br><br>Filling in the formula will get us:

<br><br>
<div class="inline-math-box">
\[
\text{SMA} = \frac{20_5 + 22_4 + 24_3 + 25_2 + 23_5}{5} = 22.8
\]
</div>

<br><br><b> This means our SMA is 22.8</b>
<br><br> We now know that our stock moves at an average of 22.8 in the past 5 days.
