  <h1>Stocks</h1>
  Stocks are a way for companies and individuals to connect capital with opportunity. When a company issues 
  stock, it is selling partial ownership of itself to the public in order to raise money. This capital can be 
  used to expand operations, develop new products, pay off debt, or invest in future growth. In return, investors 
  become shareholders, meaning they own a small portion of the company and share in its financial outcomes.
