  <p>Welcome to finance</p>

  <h3><a href="https://accountinginsights.org/what-is-cost-of-revenue-and-how-is-it-calculated/">Cost Of Revenue (COR) / Cost Of Goods Sold (GOGS)</a></h3>
<p>To calculate both (they are relatively the same) you must identify all expenses directly associated with producing and selling the goods or services. This includes things like:<br />
<br><br />
- <strong>Raw materials, wages.</strong><br />
- <strong>Equipment; hardware and such, utility (like electricity).</strong><br />
- <strong>Market price fluctuations, supplier agreements, and regulatory changes.</strong><br />
- <strong>Potential tarrifs, currency exchange rate.</strong><br />
<br><br />
The key difference between COR and GOGS is that their accounting standards are different. COR offers flexibility while COGS is more strict and requires more clarity</p>
