    Hi, welcome to my website!<br><br>
    
    I made this site as a hobby and as an advanced way to write down notes to have a good overview on my work.
    Using webdev I can share my information with friends and other people that are interested in similar topics as me. I'll try to keep this site updated
    with new information and other functionality changes. If you would like to contribute (like becoming a writer) or have suggetions for the site,
     you can personally contact me.

    <br><br>
    Have fun reading and enjoy your stay! 
    <br><br>

    <h3>How to navigate this site?</h3>

    [ <i class="new">NEW</i> ] will show for newly uploaded content. <br>

      <!--
     [ <i class="dash">#</i> ] for sorting categories properly so you can view them with ease. <br>
