<h2>W204 C63 (Pre-Facelift)</h2>
The Mercedes-Benz W204 C63 AMG is the high-performance variant of the W204 C-Class produced from 2008 to 2011 before the facelift update. Powered by the naturally aspirated 6.2L M156 V8 engine, it became known for its raw driving characteristics, aggressive exhaust note, and relatively simple AMG drivetrain compared to later turbocharged models.

<h2>Personal opinion</h2>
The W204 C63 has the best sounding V8 in the world. Especially with the long tube headers modification. Not only does the car look amazing, the sound is just the cherry on top. By far my favorite car when it comes to sound.
