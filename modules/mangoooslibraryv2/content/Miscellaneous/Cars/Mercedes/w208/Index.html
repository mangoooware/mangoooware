    <h2>W208 CLK55 AMG</h2>
The Mercedes-Benz W208 CLK55 AMG is the high-performance version of the first-generation CLK-Class, produced from 2000 to 2003. Built during Mercedes’ naturally aspirated AMG era, it features the reliable 5.4L M113 V8 paired with the 5G-Tronic automatic transmission. The CLK55 is known for its understated appearance, strong low-end torque, and comparatively simple mechanical design compared to later AMG models.
