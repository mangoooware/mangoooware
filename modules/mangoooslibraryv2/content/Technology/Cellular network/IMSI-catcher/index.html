    <h1>IMSI-catchers</h1>
    IMSI-catchers (also known as Stingrays, cell-site simulators, or fake cell towers) are surveillance devices that pretend to be a legitimate mobile phone tower. They trick nearby phones into connecting to them instead of the real network towers.
    <br><br>
    Once a phone connects, the device can capture unique identifiers like the IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) or IMEI, track the phone's location, and in some cases intercept calls, texts, or data.
    <br><br>
    They are used by law enforcement and intelligence agencies for tracking suspects, but also raise big privacy concerns because they can collect data from all phones in the area, not just targets.
    <br><br>
    <h1>What is an IMSI?</h1>
    The IMSI is a unique number stored on your SIM card that identifies you to the mobile network. It's like your phone's "subscriber ID". When your phone connects to a tower, it shares this (or a temporary version) to get service.
    <br><br>
    IMSI-catchers exploit an old weakness in mobile networks: phones always connect to the strongest signal, and older protocols (like 2G) don't make the tower prove it's real.
    <br><br>
    <h1>How an IMSI-catcher works</h1>
    The device broadcasts a stronger signal than real towers nearby, so phones automatically switch to it.

      <br>
      <b>Step 1:</b> Phone searches for the strongest cell tower signal.<br><br>
      <b>Step 2:</b> IMSI-catcher responds with a very strong fake signal.<br><br>
      <b>Step 3:</b> Phone connects to the fake tower and sends its IMSI/IMEI or other info.<br><br>
      <b>Step 4:</b> The catcher logs the data, tracks location, or even routes calls/texts through itself (man-in-the-middle).<br><br>
      <b>Step 5:</b> Often hands the phone back to a real tower so the user doesn't notice.

    <h2>1. Basic IMSI grabbing</h2>
    The simplest version just forces phones to reveal their IMSI.
    <br><br>
    This works best on older 2G/3G networks. Modern 4G/5G is harder because of better authentication, but advanced catchers can "downgrade" the connection to 2G where encryption is weak or off.
    <br><br>
    <h2>2. Location tracking</h2>
    By measuring signal strength or using multiple devices, they can pinpoint your exact location – more accurately than normal network triangulation.
    <br><br>
    <h2>3. Interception capabilities</h2>
    Advanced models can:
    <br><br>
    <div class="ema-formula-group">
      <br>
      - Intercept SMS and calls (if no or weak encryption).<br><br>
      - Block service (denial of service).<br><br>
      - Log metadata (who you call, when, websites visited if unencrypted).<br><br>
      - In rare cases, push malware or phishing messages.
      <br><br>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <h2>4. Who uses them?</h2>
    Mostly law enforcement (police, FBI, etc.) and intelligence agencies. Devices like the Harris Corporation's Stingray are sold mainly to governments.
    <br><br>
    But they can also fall into criminal hands or be used by foreign spies. There have been reports of unknown IMSI-catchers operating in cities like Washington D.C. or London.
    <br><br>
    <h2>5. Detection and risks</h2>
    Hard to detect – your phone usually shows normal signal bars.
    <br><br>
    Some signs: sudden switch to 2G, no data while voice works, or unusual battery drain.
    <br><br>
    Apps like SnoopSnitch or AIMSICD try to detect them (mostly on Android, limited success).
    <br><br>
    <h3>Privacy concerns:</h3>
    They scoop up data from everyone nearby (innocent people too) → mass surveillance risk.<br>
    Often used without strong warrants.<br>
    Can chill free speech (e.g., at protests).<br><br>
    Newer 5G standards improve protection, but not all phones/networks use the best features yet.
